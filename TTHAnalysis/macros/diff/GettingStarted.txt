*** Basic instructions for skimming the ntuples, running the modules, and producing plots ***


** Setting up your working directory **
Following the instructions at CMGTools/README.md



** Skim postprocessed ntuples for TTHnobb_fxfx sample for 2lss_tight events (2016) **
cd CMGTools/TTHAnalysis/python/plotter/
. diff-2lss-studies/skim_command.sh 2016

the skimmed sample and all needed skimmed FTs will appear here:
TTHAnalysis/macros/diff/skimmedTrees_16/



** Run the three modules over the skimmed sample at the command line **
Example commands to run all three modules on skimmed TTHnobb_fxfx sample can be found here:
TTHAnalysis/macros/diff/RunModuleCommands.sh

Each command creates a root file at:
TTHAnalysis/macros/diff/2lss_diff/<MODULE>/TTHnobb_fxfx_Friend.root
For <MODULE>={Gen, Reco, Reco_NoMassConstraint} respectively

On the command line, the speed of each module is roughly (on ingrid at UCLouvain)
Gen:  196 Events/s
Reco:  58 Events/s  (W/ & W/O Mass Constraint)
Comp: 176 Events/s



** Produce some plots **
cd TTHAnalysis/macros/diff/
root -l producePlots.cc

The produced plots are stored at
TTHAnalysis/macros/diff/1DDistPlots/

The script needs the outputs of the Gen, Reco_NoMassConstraint, and Comp, to run.
You can switch between Reco_NoMassConstraint and Reco by commenting out the appropriate input file at the top of the script
The script also prints event counts passing various criteria, and computes a few linear correlation coefficients. The details can be found in the script itself.
